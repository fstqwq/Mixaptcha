# Mixaptcha

### Abstract

We present a new CAPTCHA that requires users to distinguish between single images and mixtures of two images. We also propose some techniques to select and generate proper test sets. The test set can be automatically generated by our offline method, which requires unlabeled image sources only, while human users over-perform algorithms with a significant gap.
Compared to the most famous CAPTCHAs, the test set can be automatically generated by our offline method that requires unlabeled image source only while human users over-perform algorithms with a significant gap. The verification process is also more pleasant than the most popular CAPTCHA system.
